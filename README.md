# DolarUs
This is a Responsive Web Application wich display the Dolar Blue and Dolar Oficial actual values.Constructed with create-react-app - featuring API, Hooks, Router and custom styled components from the [Material UI library](https://material-ui.com/).
The App has a Calculator to get the profit from the "Pure" operation. Wich consist of buying USD on the offical value and then selling the USD on the "Blue" Value.

- The "Blue" value used to be much higher than the official.(Today this is not worth it)


## What did I learned while building this project?

- My first React Project and Material UI, really enjoyed the process of learning to use a component library and how to custom these default elements.
- To use react-router.
- Consume external API.
